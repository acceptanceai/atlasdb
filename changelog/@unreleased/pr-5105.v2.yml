    Adds a CacheWarming option that can control how the SweepStrategyManager
    cache is warmed on initialization. The possible options are FULL,
    LIMITED, and NONE. FULL remains the default (so default behavior is not
    changing). LIMITED causes only a max of 50 tables to be used for warming
    the cache. NONE skips warming the cache.
